# suitepad-localcache

## Note: Because the exported components in this app uses a custom permission defined in the webview app,for security reasons, the [webview app](https://github.com/sunragav/suitepad-weview) should be installed first.

This is local repository and serves stored files for the other apps to consume. In this case, the other app is the [ProxyServer](https://github.com/sunragav/suitepad-proxyserver)  which runs an http server.

To start this project from android studio, edit run-configurations and choose Nothing in the launch options.
